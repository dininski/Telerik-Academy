13 Description:
14         In order to install DR DOS you must make sure that you are
15         booting from a floppy in drive A:. DR DOS will not install
16         from drive B:. DR DOS comes on 3 1/2 inch low density
17         floppies and 5 1/4 inch Hi-density floppies. If you need
18         5 1/4 inch low-density disks (360K) send in the coupon that
19         comes with your DR DOS.
20 
21         If the boot disk hangs while trying to load, usually it means
22         there is an incompatible or faulty piece of hardware.
23 
24 	One of the things it can be is simply an older floppy 
25 	drive that is out of alignment.  Sometimes the situation
26 	can be salvaged by formatting a floppy on the boot drive
27 	with the old DOS, then doing a diskcopy. The potential 
28 	problem is that the diskcopy may not be able to read the 
29 	boot disk either. If you can't make a backup then it may 
30 	be necessary to get a replacement disk set from Digital
31 	Research (in case there is an actual error with the disk,
32 	which does sometime happen) or see about getting the 
33 	drives aligned.

37 	Another problem is where you can make valid Diskcopies 
38 	but all you get is the message "Loading...". Here the
39 	potential problem may be the computer's bios. DR DOS 
40 	must be able to direct the system to the area where DOS 
41 	Kernel files are located. Older bioses are not able to 
42 	perform this function. If your bios dates from around
43 	1987 or earlier you may need an update.

47 	And finally, if you can read the disks but are unable to 
48 	format a disk or make a diskcopy DR DOS may think you 
49 	have a different type of floppy than you actually have.
50 	Another symptom of this is if you are making a floppy
51 	installation and DR DOS asks you for 5 1/4" floppies
52 	when you actually have 3 1/2" floppies. If this is an XT
53         type computer (by which we mean it has no CMOS config-
54 	uration program) then you can place a DRIVPARM state-
55 	ment in your CONFIG.SYS. Refer to the DR DOS manual to
56 	see how to use this parameter. DRIVPARM uses no RAM. It
57 	merely updates the DR DOS drive tables with the type
58 	drive you specify. If your computer does have a CMOS 
59 	setup program then you need to correct the entries for
60         your floppy drives in CMOS.
